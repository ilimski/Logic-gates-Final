# Logic-gates-Final-Project
## This is simulator of logic gates
### logic gate (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR and XNOR)
### A logic gate is a device that acts as a building block for digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital circuits. Most electronic devices we use today will have some form of logic gates in them. For example, logic gates can be used in technologies such as smartphones, tablets or within memory devices.
